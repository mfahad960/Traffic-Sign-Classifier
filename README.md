Traffic sign classifier which uses a custom built and optimised CNN model. The dataset used is the German Traffic Sign Benchmark dataset and it has more than 40 classes, more than 50,000 images in total, and a large, realistic database. After the CNN model is trained, it is integrated into a web application, providing a user-friendly interface for traffic sign classification. Users can upload images of traffic signs to the application, which then passes the image through the pre-trained CNN model for classification. The model's classification result is displayed to the user, providing immediate feedback on the identified traffic sign.
